                                            <p class="mad-text-big">There is something special about the food cooked or served in earthen pots - be it Handi Mutton, Handi Chicken, Handi Biryani, Matka Kulfi, or Kulhad Wali Chai. There is an old-world charm; earthly magic around them. </p>

                                            <p class="mad-text-big">Champaran Mutton is also called Ahuna Meat or Batlohi, which means a Handi in colloquial. Like any other meat preparation in Bihar, it uses similar spices and ingredients but is cooked on slow charcoal or wood fire in an earthen pot. Champaran Meat uses whole spices, fresh ground spices, garlic bulbs, and is not stirred with the ladle. </p>

                                            <p class="mad-text-big">Unlike others, we follow a pure traditional cooking style! Every dish is cooked, and delivered in natural clay handis to keep the freshness, authenticity, aroma, and flavours alive. </p>

                                            <p class="mad-text-big">We take pride in using the freshest and highest quality ingredients maintaining stringent quality checks &amp; processes before preparing our food. </p>
                                            <p class="mad-text-big">We are a firm believer in, 'Love at First Bite', and deliver the quality that is a delight with every bite. </p>

                                            <p class="mad-text-big">We work with passion and put all our heart into crafting the most authentic Handi Meat with an inimitable character thatâ€™s truly the taste of India.</p>

                                            <p class="mad-text-big">From Champaran Mutton and Laal Mans to Laung Latika - every dish is freshly made by preserving the authentic flavours straight from the heartland. </p>
